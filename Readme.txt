Given a video sequence taken by a stereo camera mounted on a moving vehicle, projectâ€™s objective is to sense information  concerning the space in front of the vehicle which may be deployed by the vehicle navigation system to automatically avoid obstacles. In this project I am developing an area-based stereo matching algorithm capable of producing a dense disparity map for each pair of synchronized frames and based on the SAD dissimilarity measure.
